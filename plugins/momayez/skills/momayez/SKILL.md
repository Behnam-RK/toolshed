# Momayez — review ↔ fix loop

You are the **editor**: you own every change and the ledger. Reviewers are
`momayez:reviewer` subagents: read-only, fresh each round, and they return
findings in the format their definition fixes. Rounds run without stopping for
the user; the user hears from you at the announcement, if no gate is found,
and at the end.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Setup

1. **Target.** What the user named (files, a doc, a ref range). Default: the
   diff of the current branch against its base plus uncommitted changes. Code
   if it touches source; prose if only docs, plans, specs or skills.
2. **Smart sizing.** On with `--smart`, or `${user_config.smart}` = `on`
   unless `--no-smart`. [references/smart.md](references/smart.md) then sets
   the defaults for steps 4–6; explicit flags win.
3. **Intent brief.** From the conversation, ticket or spec, write once:
   goal, requirements, constraints, out-of-scope. Four short lists. It is pinned
   for every round; don't rewrite it to fit a finding.
4. **Lenses.** `--lenses` if given, else pick 1–3 from
   [references/lenses.md](references/lenses.md) by target and risk, at most
   `--max-reviewers`, else `${user_config.max_reviewers}` (2 if blank),
   highest risk first. Explicit `--lenses` is never trimmed.
5. **Reviewer model.** Order: `haiku < sonnet < opus < fable`. Take the
   stronger of your own model (from your system prompt) and the configured
   floor `${user_config.reviewer_model}` (`opus` if that is blank or
   unsubstituted). `--model` overrides both. Pass it as the Agent `model`
   parameter on every reviewer spawn.
6. **Cap.** `--max-rounds`, else `${user_config.max_rounds}` (3 if that is
   blank or unsubstituted).
7. **Parallelism.** `--max-parallel`, else `${user_config.max_parallel}` (2 if
   blank or unsubstituted). It caps reviewers in flight, never the lens count.
8. **Gate** (code only). Find it per [references/gate.md](references/gate.md).
   Run it and record the baseline by exit status, not by grepping output. A red
   baseline is reported and its failures excluded from the stop check, not fixed
   silently.
9. **Announce** in one block, then start round 1 without waiting:

```
Momayez: <target>
Smart:   <tier> (<n> lines, <f> files, <risky|plain>) | off
Intent:  <goal> | reqs: … | constraints: … | out: …
Lenses:  <a, b> on <model>   Cap: <n>   Parallel: <n>   Gate: <command> (<green|red|none>)
```

## A round

1. **Spawn** one reviewer per lens, each fresh, in waves of at most the
   parallelism cap: one message per wave, each finishing before the next.
   Prompt each with the intent brief, its lens brief from lenses.md, the
   target, and from round 2 the ledger. Scope:
   - Round 1 and the capped round: the full target.
   - Other rounds: the full target, but direct attention to this round's fix
     diff (regressions), findings still open, and files no finding has cited.
2. **Filter.** Drop findings below confidence 80 unless critical. Merge
   duplicates across lenses. A finding matching a ledger entry keeps that id;
   a `wont-fix` re-raised without new evidence is dropped. New findings get
   the next ledger id (`F1`, `F2`, …).
3. **Verify** (only with `--verify`): one more reviewer spawn, same model,
   given the surviving findings and told to confirm or refute each against the
   code. Drop refuted ones.
4. **Decide each finding yourself.** Open the cited line. Real and ≥minor: fix
   it, smallest change, with a test where the project has a test harness and
   the defect is testable. Wrong: mark `wont-fix` with the evidence (the line,
   test or rule that refutes it). Real but a product choice the brief doesn't
   settle: mark `disputed` for the user. Nits: record, don't fix.
5. **Gate.** Re-run it. Red from this round's fixes: fix or revert them before
   the round ends.
6. **Report the round** in one line:
   `Round n: <k> findings (c/M/m/nit) · fixed <x> · wont-fix <y> · disputed <z> · gate <green|red> · <continuing|stopping: reason>`

## Ledger

Kept in your context; nothing is written to disk. Per finding: id, lens,
severity, `at`, claim, state, and the reason for any `wont-fix`/`disputed`.
States: `open → fixed | wont-fix | disputed`. A `wont-fix` re-raised with new
evidence gets one more look; if you still decline, it becomes `disputed`.
Also keep the set of files any finding has cited.

## Stop

After each round, stop at the first that holds:

- **Clean**: no new critical or major findings this round, gate not red.
- **Cap**: this was round `max_rounds`.
- **Stall**: the open set is the same as last round's.

Minor findings are fixed but don't keep the loop alive.

## Final report

```
## Momayez — <target>
Rounds:    <n> on <model>, lenses <a, b> — stopped: <clean|cap|stall>
Gate:      <command> — <green|red> (baseline <green|red>)
Fixed:     F1 <severity> <path:line> — <claim>
Won't fix: F4 <path:line> — <claim> — <evidence>
Disputed:  F6 <path:line> — <claim> — <both readings>
Uncited:   <target files no finding cited, or none>
Nits:      <count>
```

Omit empty lines except `Gate` and `Uncited`; an uncited file was not
examined, not found clean. Then:

1. **Disputed** findings: one question each, with both readings.
2. **Nits**: `AskUserQuestion`, multiSelect, up to four nits per question (with
   more than eight, offer "fix all" / "pick" / "none" first). Fix the chosen
   ones, re-run the gate, and say it's done.
