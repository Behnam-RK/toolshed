# Lenses

Pass a reviewer its lens name and the brief below verbatim.

## Picking

Pick 1–3, smallest set that covers the risk:

| Target | Default | Add when |
|---|---|---|
| Code | correctness, spec-fit | one of the code lenses below |
| Prose (spec, plan, doc, skill) | accuracy, clarity | spec-fit: the doc answers a request or ticket. |
| Mixed | correctness, accuracy | spec-fit when there is a stated requirement. |

Code lenses, added when the target has:

- **security**: auth, input parsing, IO, shell, SQL, secrets.
- **tests**: new behaviour without tests.
- **performance**: hot paths, loops over unbounded data, queries.
- **simplicity**: large new abstractions.
- **docs**: changed public symbols, CLI flags or config.

## correctness

Does it do what it claims on every reachable path? Off-by-one, wrong
condition, null/empty/error paths, races, resource leaks, broken invariants,
wrong API use. Not: style, naming, design preference.
Critical: wrong output or crash on a normal path. Major: bug on a plausible path.

## security

Untrusted input reaching shell, SQL, paths, HTML, deserialisers; authz checks
missing or bypassable; secrets in code or logs; unsafe defaults. Not:
theoretical attacks needing access the attacker already has.
Critical: exploitable from outside. Major: exploitable with a plausible foothold.

## spec-fit

Hold the target against the intent brief line by line: every requirement met,
no constraint broken, nothing out-of-scope added. Not: requirements the brief
does not state.
Major: requirement unmet or constraint broken. Minor: scope creep.

## simplicity

Code or structure that is harder than the problem: needless layers, single-use
abstractions, duplicated logic, dead code, configuration for fixed values.
Not: rewriting working code into your preferred shape.
Major only when the complexity hides a bug or blocks the stated goal; else minor.

## tests

New or changed behaviour without a test that would fail if it broke; tests
that assert nothing, mock the thing under test, or pass for the wrong reason.
Not: coverage numbers, test style.
Major: a changed critical path is untested. Minor: edge case untested.

## performance

Work that scales worse than it needs to on realistic input: N+1 queries,
quadratic loops over unbounded data, repeated IO in loops, blocking calls on
hot paths. Not: micro-optimisation without a hot path.
Major: user-visible on realistic input. Minor: wasteful but bounded.

## docs

Do the docs still match the changed code? READMEs, docstrings, comments,
changelogs, ADRs and `--help` text that describe a renamed, removed or changed
symbol, flag or config key; a new public surface or a settled decision with no
record. If `command -v mostofi` succeeds, run
`mostofi scan --json`: its leads are repo-wide (`--base` only feeds the
`changed-without-docs` rule, off by default), so keep those on files or symbols
the target touches, and verify each against the code before reporting it.
Not: style, length, or docs for unchanged code.
Major: a reader acting on the doc would fail. Minor: stale or missing prose that misleads nobody.

## accuracy

Every factual claim checked against its source: code, docs, the conversation,
cited URLs. Wrong names, stale behaviour, commands that would fail, numbers
that don't add up. Not: wording.
Major: a reader acting on it would fail. Minor: misleading but recoverable.

## clarity

Can the intended reader act on it without asking? Missing steps, undefined
terms, ambiguous instructions, buried key point, contradictions between
sections. Not: tone, length preference.
Major: ambiguity that leads to the wrong action. Minor: friction.
