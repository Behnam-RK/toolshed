Updated:   <file> — <what changed and why>
Appended:  <file> — <new docstring / changelog line>
Recorded:  <ADR-NNNN> — <decision captured; index updated>
Extracted: <code site> → <doc> — <what moved; pointer left behind>
Deduped:   <doc> — <duplicate folded in from where>
Trimmed:   <file> — <stale comment / resolved TODO removed>
Flagged:   <needs the author: e.g. "unrecorded decision, ADR proposed but not approved", "code is convoluted; doc can't fix it">
